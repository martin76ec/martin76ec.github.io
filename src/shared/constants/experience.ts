      "Migrated business logic and billing systems to modern APIs, improving feature delivery and legal compliance. Enhanced security in PHP applications and enforced coding standards. Integrated observability tools with Grafana, doubling response times to incidents. Managed CI/CD with GitHub, automating linting, testing, and deployments. Led AWS infrastructure migration and refactored codebases, cutting billing errors by 50%. Ensured data integrity with idempotent mechanisms and optimized queuing with BullMQ and Redis, reducing known errors by 99%.",
